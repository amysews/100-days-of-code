# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20th September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked upto task 24 on freeCodeCamps Front End Development Certification. Covered basics of HTML/CSS stylesheets, classes, images etc.

**Thoughts:** Worked through it pretty quick, most of it seen before just obviously forgot a lot of it. Hopefully using this language everyday will keep it in my head.

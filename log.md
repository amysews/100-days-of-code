# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20th September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked upto task 24 on freeCodeCamps Front End Development Certification. Covered basics of HTML/CSS stylesheets, classes, images etc.

**Thoughts:** Worked through it pretty quick, most of it seen before just obviously forgot a lot of it. Hopefully using this language everyday will keep it in my head.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

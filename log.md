# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20th September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked upto task 24 on freeCodeCamps Front End Development Certification. Covered basics of HTML/CSS stylesheets, classes, images etc.

**Thoughts:** Worked through it pretty quick, most of it seen before just obviously forgot a lot of it. Hopefully using this language everyday will keep it in my head.

### Day 2: 21st September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished HTML5 and CSS on freeCodeCamps Front End Development Certification.

**Thoughts:** Again pretty quick, nothing that new or crazy.

### Day 3: 22nd September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed all of Responsive Design with Bootstrap on freeCodeCamps Front End Development Certification.

**Thoughts:** Supposed to take 5 hours... think it took me 50 minutes. Had looked at Bootstrap before

### Day 4: 23rd September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed jQuery on freeCodeCamps Front End Development Certification. Did the Tribute page on Ada Lovelace.

**Thoughts:** Quite a jump introducing jQuery - just went with it but totally different to the stuff from before. Then did the tribute page on CodePen - found this really tough. Just the little things you forget to make stuff work - what to declare where. Found it hard not to do any CSS either - had to use just Bootstrap to format the page. Not very proud of it but it ticked the boxes. Next up is my own personal portfolio page. Quite surprised at how good the example sites are - I feel like they haven't covered a lot of this stuff yet but we're supposed to just google it and learn as we go??? Going to leave this project for tomorrow and do some proper planning and research. Need to remember they have allowed like 40 hours to do this project so no need to rush.

### Day 5: 24th September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sketched out what I want my portfolio page to look like. Got the navbar working but then struggled.

**Thoughts:** Took A LOT of googling to get the navbar to look how I imagined it and I'm still not sure it's the 'best' way to do it - but realising efficiencies and 'best' will come with time and practice. Really struggled with adding cover image and text under the navbar - had to leave it for the night - need to learn about layouts to implement this.

### Day 6: 25th September 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the cover image and text. Got it working somehow but then decided it wasn't a very good method so tried what I thought was a better way and now it's disappeared altogether.

**Thoughts:** Really struggling with the layout - learning about sections, divs, block-elements, rows... think nesting / russian dolls. More research required. Thought I got somewhere when I played around with this code but when I tried to apply the learning to my file - not working! https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_div_capitals
